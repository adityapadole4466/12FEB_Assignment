    "Q.1 what is an exception in python? write the difference between exceptions and syntax errors\n",
    "ANS--->\n",
    "In Python, an exception is an error that occurs during the execution of a program.\n",
    "When a program encounters an exceptional situation or error, it raises an exception \n",
    "object that contains information about the error, such as its type and message. \n",
    "This allows the program to handle the error gracefully and take appropriate action, rather than simply crashing.\n",
    "\n",
    "Exceptions can be raised by the program code itself, or they can be raised by the Python \n",
    "interpreter in response to some other problem, such as a file not being found or a division by zero.\n",
    "Some common built-in exceptions in Python include ValueError, TypeError, NameError, and ZeroDivisionError.\n",
    "\n",
    "On the other hand, a syntax error is a type of error that occurs when the Python interpreter encounters \n",
    "invalid syntax in the code. This means that the code does not conform to the syntax rules of the Python\n",
    "language, and therefore cannot be compiled and executed. Examples of syntax errors include\n",
    "missing parentheses, incorrect indentation, and misspelled keywords.\n",
    "\n",
    "The key difference between exceptions and syntax errors is that exceptions occur during the execution \n",
    "of the program, while syntax errors occur during the compilation of the program. Syntax errors prevent\n",
    "the program from running at all, while exceptions can occur at any time during program execution and\n",
    "can be caught and handled by the program. Additionally, syntax errors are always caused by problems\n",
    "with the program code itself, while exceptions can be caused by a wide range of factors, both within and \n",
